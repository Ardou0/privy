# Privy Backend

Welcome to the backend of Privy! This is the engine powering secure messaging, user management, and real-time communication for the app. Here’s a deep dive into the tech, architecture, and design choices behind the scenes.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

- **Node.js + Express**: REST API for authentication, user profiles, conversations, and file management
- **WebSocket (ws)**: Real-time messaging, typing indicators, notifications
- **MySQL**: Relational database for users, messages, conversations, and files
- **Docker**: Containerized for easy deployment and development
- **(Future) Kubernetes**: Possible for scaling and orchestration—challenge accepted!

---

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

- **api/**: Main Express app, routes, controllers, models, config
- **db/**: SQL schema and initialization scripts
- **websocket/**: WebSocket server, authentication, services (messaging, typing, notifications)
- **docker-compose.yml**: Docker setup for backend and database
- **.env**: Environment variables for config and secrets

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Design Choices

- **Express**: Simple, flexible, and well-supported for REST APIs
- **ws**: Lightweight WebSocket library for real-time features
- **MySQL**: Chosen for reliability and relational data modeling
- **JWT**: Secure user authentication and session management
- **Docker**: Makes local dev and deployment easy; just run and go!
- **Modular Structure**: Controllers, models, and routes are separated for clarity and maintainability

---

## 🔄 Main Features & Interactions

- **User Auth**: Register, login, JWT tokens, password hashing
- **Conversations**: Create, invite, accept/decline, manage participants
- **Messaging**: Send/receive messages, end-to-end encryption support
- **File Handling**: Upload/download files in chunks
- **WebSocket Events**: Real-time message delivery, typing notifications, room management
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handler for API responses

---

## 🐳 Docker Support

- The backend is fully containerized with Docker. Just use `docker-compose up` to start the API, WebSocket server, and MySQL database.
- This makes it easy to develop, test, and deploy anywhere.
- (Kubernetes support could be added later for scaling and orchestration—maybe as a future challenge!)

## 📚 How to Run

```sh
# Start everything with Docker
cd backend
nano .env   # Set up your environment variables
# Edit .env for your DB credentials and secrets

docker-compose up      # Start API, WebSocket, and MySQL
```

## 🤔 Why This Stack?

- I wanted to learn how to build a "real" backend for secure apps
- Node.js and Express are beginner-friendly but powerful
- MySQL is robust and easy to manage
- Docker makes everything portable and reproducible
- WebSocket adds the real-time magic

## 🚧 Next Updates

Here's what I plan to improve in the backend in the next Update:

- **Refresh token implementation**: More robust authentication and session management
- **Group conversations**: Support for multi-user chats and group management
- **Better error handling**: More detailed and user-friendly error responses
- **Rate limiting & security**: Protect against abuse and attacks
- **Kubernetes support**: For scaling and orchestration (challenge!)
- **Real implementation of file encoded transfer**: Actually fragment and transfer files securely between users. *(Note: This is not my preferred solution, as it raises many technical and moral questions—like how the DB can handle files it can't identify or parse, and whether it's right to store or transmit files without knowing their nature. Still, it's a technical challenge worth exploring!)*
- More improvements coming!

## 📝 Final Note

This backend is a learning project. There are probably bugs, security holes, and things to improve. If you spot anything wrong, let me know—I'll try to fix it and learn from your feedback!

Thanks for checking out the Privy backend! 🚀
